#### edgeR_GLM

####### if you have more than 3 samples you can make a model.The model knows a bit more about the dataset b/c you provide all the samples at once. So you can do more comparisons.

The glm approach to multiple groups is similar to the classic approach, but permits more
general comparisons to be made.
